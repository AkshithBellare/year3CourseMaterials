Amhdals law
	Speedup only those parts of the program which takes the maximum amount of time to execute.
	A certain part can be optimized and it takes x fraction of the entire execution time.
	let the optimization in the processor speed up execution of that part by y times. 
	
	then t(new) = t - t*x - (t*x / y)
	 
	 speedup = (t / t(new)) = 1 / (1 - x + x/y)
	 
	 "The portion of the program that you cannot improve will become the bottleneck"
	 
	 Assuming speedup can be infinite i.e y = infinite this gives speedup = 1 / (1 - x)
	 
	 Amdahl's law can be used to derive upper bound on acheivable speedup in parallel 		 computer.
	 
	 maximum acheivable speedup = t / (s*t + (1-s)*t / P)
	 
	 
	 in the limit, that considering one has a machine with infinite number of processor the speedup is 1 / s.
	 
	 even if s is 0.05 the speedup is only 20.
